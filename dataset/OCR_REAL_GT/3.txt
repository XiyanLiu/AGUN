Aesop's Fables
The Town Mouse and the Country
Mouse
Now you must know that a Town Mouse once upon a time went on a
visit to his cousin in the country. He was rough and ready, this cousin,
but he loved his town friend and made him heartily welcome. Beans and
bacon, cheese and bread, were all he had to offer, but he offered them
freely. The Town Mouse rather turned up his long nose at this country
fare, and said: "I cannot understand, Cousin, how you can put up with
such poor food as this, but of course you cannot expect anything better in
the country; come you with me and I will show you how to live. When
you have been in town a week you will wonder how you could ever have
stood a country life." No sooner said than done: the two mice set off for
the town and arrived at the Town Mouse's residence late at night. "You
will want some refreshment after our long journey," said the polite Town
Mouse, and took his friend into the grand dining-room. There they found
the remains of a fine feast, and soon the two mice were eating up jellies
and cakes and all that was nice. Suddenly they heard growling and
barking. "What is that?" said the Country Mouse. "It is only the dogs of
the house," answered the other. "Only!" said the Country Mouse. "I do
not like that music at my dinner." Just at that moment the door flew open,
in came two huge mastiffs, and the two mice had to scamper down and run
off. "Good-bye, Cousin," said the Country Mouse, "What! going so
soon?" said the other. "Yes," he replied;
"Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear."
