THE TEMPEST
precursors O' th' dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary And sightoutrunning
were not; the fire and cracks Of sulphurous roaring the most
mighty Neptune Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble, Yea,
his dread trident shake. PROSPERO. My brave spirit! Who was so firm,
so constant, that this coil Would not infect his reason? ARIEL. Not a soul
But felt a fever of the mad, and play'd Some tricks of desperation. All but
mariners Plung'd in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel, Then all afire
with me; the King's son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring-then like reeds,
not hair- Was the first man that leapt; cried 'Hell is empty, And all the
devils are here.' PROSPERO. Why, that's my spirit! But was not this nigh
shore? ARIEL. Close by, my master. PROSPERO. But are they, Ariel, safe?
ARIEL. Not a hair perish'd; On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
But fresher than before; and, as thou bad'st me, In troops I have dispers'd
them 'bout the isle. The King's son have I landed by himself, Whom I left
cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting, His

hid; The mariners all under hatches stowed, Who, with a charm join'd to
their suff'red labour, I have left asleep; and for the rest o' th' fleet, Which I
dispers'd, they all have met again, And are upon the Mediterranean flote
Bound sadly home for Naples, Supposing that they saw the King's ship
wreck'd, And his great person perish. PROSPERO. Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform'd; but there's more work. What is the time o' th' day?
ARIEL. Past the mid season. PROSPERO. At least two glasses. The time
'twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously. ARIEL. Is
there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee
what thou hast promis'd, Which is not yet perform'd me. PROSPERO.
How now, moody? What is't thou canst demand? ARIEL. My liberty.
PROSPERO. Before the time be out? No more! ARIEL. I prithee,
Remember I have done thee worthy service, Told thee no lies, made thee
no mistakings, serv'd Without or grudge or grumblings. Thou didst
promise To bate me a full year. PROSPERO. Dost thou forget From what
