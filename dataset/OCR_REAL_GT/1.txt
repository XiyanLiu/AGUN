THE TEMPEST
What's the matter? SEBASTIAN. Whiles we stood here securing your
repose, Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls, or
rather lions; did't not wake you? It struck mine ear most terribly. ALONSO.
I heard nothing. ANTONIO. O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear, To
make an earthquake! Sure it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions.
ALONSO. Heard you this, Gonzalo? GONZALO. Upon mine honour, sir,
I heard a humming, And that a strange one too, which did awake me; I
shak'd you, sir, and cried; as mine eyes open'd, I saw their weapons drawnthere
was a noise, That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard, Or that
we quit this place. Let's draw our weapons. ALONSO. Lead off this
ground; and let's make further search For my poor son. GONZALO.
Heavens keep him from these beasts! For he is, sure, i' th' island.
ALONSO. Lead away. ARIEL. Prospero my lord shall know what I have
done; So, King, go safely on to seek thy son. [Exeunt]
