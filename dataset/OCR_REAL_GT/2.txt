THE TEMPEST
Merrily, merrily shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the
bough.
PROSPERO. Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee; But yet
thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so. To the King's ship, invisible as thou
art; There shalt thou find the mariners asleep Under the hatches; the
master and the boatswain Being awake, enforce them to this place; And
presently, I prithee. ARIEL. I drink the air before me, and return Or ere
your pulse twice beat. [Exit] GONZALO. All torment, trouble, wonder
and amazement, Inhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us Out of this
fearful country! PROSPERO. Behold, Sir King, The wronged Duke of
