Chapter 3
Probability and Information
Theory
In this chapter, we describe probability theory and information theory.
Probability theory is a mathematical framework for representing uncertain
statements. It provides a means of quantifying uncertainty and axioms for deriving
new uncertain statements. In artificial intelligence applications, we use probability
theory in two major ways. First, the laws of probability tell us how AI systems
should reason, so we design our algorithms to compute or approximate various
expressions derived using probability theory. Second, we can use probability and
statistics to theoretically analyze the behavior of proposed AI systems.
Probability theory is a fundamental tool of many disciplines of science and
engineering. We provide this chapter to ensure that readers whose background is
primarily in software engineering with limited exposure to probability theory can
understand the material in this book.
While probability theory allows us to make uncertain statements and reason
in the presence of uncertainty, information allows us to quantify the amount of
uncertainty in a probability distribution.
If you are already familiar with probability theory and information theory,
you may wish to skip all of this chapter except for Sec. 3.14, which describes the
graphs we use to describe structured probabilistic models for machine learning. If
you have absolutely no prior experience with these subjects, this chapter should
be sufficient to successfully carry out deep learning research projects, but we do
suggest that you consult an additional resource, such as Jaynes (2003).
