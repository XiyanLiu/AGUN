CHAPTER 5. MACHINE LEARNING BASICS
hand-designed, it can usually be understood as using a special-case optimizer. Some
models such as decision trees or k-means require special-case optimizers because
their cost functions have flat regions that make them inappropriate for minimization
by gradient-based optimizers. Recognizing that most machine learning algorithms
can be described using this recipe helps to see the different algorithms as part of a
taxonomy of methods for doing related tasks that work for similar reasons, rather
than as a long list of algorithms that each have separate justifications.
5.11 Challenges Motivating Deep Learning
The simple machine learning algorithms described in this chapter work very well on
a wide variety of important problems. However, they have not succeeded in solving
the central problems in AI, such as recognizing speech or recognizing objects.
The development of deep learning was motivated in part by the failure of
traditional algorithms to generalize well on such AI tasks.
This section is about how the challenge of generalizing to new examples becomes
exponentially more difficult when working with high-dimensional data, and how
the mechanisms used to achieve generalization in traditional machine learning
are insufficient to learn complicated functions in high-dimensional spaces. Such
spaces also often impose high computational costs. Deep learning was designed to
overcome these and other obstacles.
5.11.1 The Curse of Dimensionality
Many machine learning problems become exceedingly difficult when the number
of dimensions in the data is high. This phenomenon is known as the curse
of dimensionality. Of particular concern is that the number of possible distinct
configurations of a set of variables increases exponentially as the number of variables
increases.
