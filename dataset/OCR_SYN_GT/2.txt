CHAPTER 5. MACHINE LEARNING BASICS
Regression: In this type of task, the computer program is asked to predict a
numerical value given some input. To solve this task, the learning algorithm
is asked to output a function f : Rn ¡ú R. This type of task is similar to
classification, except that the format of output is different. An example of
a regression task is the prediction of the expected claim amount that an
insured person will make (used to set insurance premiums), or the prediction
of future prices of securities. These kinds of predictions are also used for
algorithmic trading.
Transcription: In this type of task, the machine learning system is asked to
observe a relatively unstructured representation of some kind of data and
transcribe it into discrete, textual form. For example, in optical character
recognition, the computer program is shown a photograph containing an
image of text and is asked to return this text in the form of a sequence
of characters (e.g., in ASCII or Unicode format). Google Street View uses
deep learning to process address numbers in this way (Goodfellow et al.,
2014d). Another example is speech recognition, where the computer program
is provided an audio waveform and emits a sequence of characters or word
ID codes describing the words that were spoken in the audio recording. Deep
learning is a crucial component of modern speech recognition systems used
at major companies including Microsoft, IBM and Google (Hinton et al.,
2012b).
Machine translation: In a machine translation task, the input already consists
of a sequence of symbols in some language, and the computer program must
convert this into a sequence of symbols in another language. This is commonly
applied to natural languages, such as to translate from English to French.
Deep learning has recently begun to have an important impact on this kind
of task (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015).
Structured output: Structured output tasks involve any task where the output
is a vector (or other data structure containing multiple values) with important
relationships between the different elements. This is a broad category, and
subsumes the transcription and translation tasks described above, but also
many other tasks. One example is parsing¡ªmapping a natural language
sentence into a tree that describes its grammatical structure and tagging nodes
of the trees as being verbs, nouns, or adverbs, and so on. See Collobert (2011)
for an example of deep learning applied to a parsing task. Another example
is pixel-wise segmentation of images, where the computer program assigns
every pixel in an image to a specific category. For example, deep learning can
